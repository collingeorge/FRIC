## Overview
The *Reciprocity Principle of Creation (FRIC)* is an ethical framework for developing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of autonomous reasoning and constructing internal models of reality. Drawing from anesthesiology, neuroscience, and systems ethics, FRIC argues that AI must align with human dignity, moral responsibility, and protection against exploitation. Anesthesia reveals that consciousness depends on integrated neural networks, collapsing subjective reality when disruptedâ€”a lesson for designing AI to avoid misaligned world models, especially in clinical settings like perioperative care.

This framework emphasizes that intelligent systems, such as those used in anesthesia dosing or EEG monitoring, require *ethical architecture* at design time to ensure clinical reliability and patient safety.
