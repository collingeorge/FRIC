## Overview
The *Reciprocity Principle of Creation (FRIC)* is an ethical framework for developing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of autonomous reasoning and constructing internal models of reality. Drawing from anesthesiology, neuroscience, and systems ethics, FRIC ensures AI aligns with human dignity, moral responsibility, and protection against exploitation. For example, AI-driven EEG monitoring in anesthesiology risks misinterpreting consciousness without ethical safeguards, potentially causing dosing errors. Anesthesia shows that consciousness relies on integrated neural networks, collapsing subjective reality when disruptedâ€”a critical lesson for designing AI to avoid misaligned world models in clinical settings like perioperative care.

This framework mandates *ethical architecture* at design time to ensure clinical reliability and patient safety in applications like anesthesia dosing and monitoring.

## Abstract
See pages 1â€“2 of [The_Reciprocity_Principle_of_Creation_v1.0.pdf](The_Reciprocity_Principle_of_Creation_v1.0.pdf) for the full abstract, which outlines how anesthesiaâ€™s insights into consciousness inform the ethical design of AI systems.

## Development Status
This is a living research project. Future versions will expand on:
- **Ethical Engineering Model**: Algorithms to enforce FRICâ€™s Ethics pillar, e.g., bias mitigation in anesthesia dosing systems to prevent errors like propofol overdosing.
- **AI Risk Classification**: Categorizing risks by cognitive architecture for clinical AI applications, such as EEG misinterpretation.
- **FRIC Safety Protocol**: Verification layers for AI in critical systems, ensuring reliability in perioperative monitoring.
- **Applied Guidance**: Practical protocols for medicine and autonomous systems, developed with input from anesthesiologists and AI developers.
